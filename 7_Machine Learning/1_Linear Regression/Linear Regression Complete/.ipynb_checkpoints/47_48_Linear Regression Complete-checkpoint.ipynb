    "# STEPS IN BUILDING A REGRESSION MODEL\n",
    "In this section, we will explain the steps used in building a regression model. Building a regression\n",
    "model is an iterative process and several iterations may be required before finalizing the appropriate\n",
    "model.\n",
    "#### STEP 1: Collect/Extract Data\n",
    "The first step in building a regression model is to collect or extract data on the dependent (outcome) vari-\n",
    "able and independent (feature) variables from different data sources. Data collection in many cases can\n",
    "be time-consuming and expensive, even when the organization has well-designed enterprise resource\n",
    "planning (ERP) system.\n",
    "#### STEP 2: Pre-Process the Data\n",
    "Before the model is built, it is essential to ensure the quality of the data for issues such as reliability, com-\n",
    "pleteness, usefulness, accuracy, missing data, and outliers.\n",
    "1. Data imputation techniques may be used to deal with missing data. Use of descriptive statistics and visualization (such as box plot and scatter plot) may be used to identify the existence of outliers and variability in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Many new variables (such as the ratio of variables or product of variables) can be derived (aka feature engineering) and also used in model building.\n",
    "3. Categorical data has must be pre-processed using dummy variables (part of feature engineering) before it is used in the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 3: Dividing Data into Training and Validation Datasets\n",
    "In this stage the data is divided into two subsets (sometimes more than two subsets): training dataset\n",
    "and validation or test dataset. The proportion of training dataset is usually between 70% and 80% of the\n",
    "data and the remaining data is treated as the validation data. The subsets may be created using random/­\n",
    "stratified sampling procedure. This is an important step to measure the performance of the model using\n",
    "dataset not used in model building. It is also essential to check for any overfitting of the model. In many\n",
    "cases, multiple training and multiple test data are used (called cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEP 4: Perform Descriptive Analytics or Data Exploration\n",
    "It is always a good practice to perform descriptive analytics before moving to building a predictive ana-\n",
    "lytics model. Descriptive statistics will help us to understand the variability in the model and visualiza-\n",
    "tion of the data through, say, a box plot which will show if there are any outliers in the data. Another\n",
    "visualization technique, the scatter plot, may also reveal if there is any obvious relationship between the\n",
    "two variables under consideration. Scatter plot is useful to describe the functional relationship between\n",
    "the dependent or outcome variable and features.\n",
    "#### STEP 5: Build the Model\n",
    "The model is built using the training dataset to estimate the regression parameters. The method of\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used to estimate the regression parameters.\n",
    "#### STEP 6: Perform Model Diagnostics\n",
    "Regression is often misused since many times the modeler fails to perform necessary diagnostics tests\n",
    "before applying the model. Before it can be applied, it is necessary that the model created is validated\n",
    "for all model assumptions including the definition of the function form. If the model assumptions are\n",
    "violated, then the modeler must use remedial measure.\n",
    "#### STEP 7: Validate the Model and Measure Model Accuracy\n",
    "A major concern in analytics is over-fitting, that is, the model may perform very well on the training\n",
    "dataset, but may perform badly in validation dataset. It is important to ensure that the model perfor-\n",
    "mance is consistent on the validation dataset as is in the training dataset. In fact, the model may be cross-\n",
    "validated using multiple training and test datasets.\n",
    "#### STEP 8: Decide on Model Deployment\n",
    "The final step in the regression model is to develop a deployment strategy in the form of actionable items\n",
    "and business rules that can be used by the organization."
